# Today I Learned 

My Today I Learned snippets. Inspired by simonw/til, which I spotted on somewhere while looking for cool profile readmes. These are things I write about as I'm too lazy to write actual blog posts, but hopefully this will serve as an entry point to writing blog posts.

## Categories
- [Jest](#jest)
- [Typescript](#typescript)

### Jest

- [Mocking Hooks used in React Components](https://github.com/metruzanca/til/blob/master/jest/Mocking_Hooks.md) - 2020-08-06

### Typescript

#### Todo
- [ ] Automate updating this readme via github workflows
- [ ] Do something cool like simonw did, but with nodejs/rust instead of python, just because.
